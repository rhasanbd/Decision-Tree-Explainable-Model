# Decision Tree - An Explainable Model

If github in unable to render a Jupyter notebook, copy the link of the notebook and enter into the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/


These notebooks provide an introduction to the Decision Tree model. 

- Notebook 1: Decision Tree: Traing & Visualization

In this notebook, we introduce the Decision Tree model and the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm for its training.

      -- Motivate the Decision Tree model by comparing it with the ANN

      -- Common sense reasoning using Decision Tree

      -- Decision Tree: Advantages & Disadvantages

      -- Decision Tree: Algorithms

      -- Decision Tree: Computational Complexity

      -- Training Decision Tree using the CART algorithm

      -- Visualize a Decision Tree using Graphviz Graph Visualization software

      -- Study the Main Limitation of Decision Tree: High Variance


- Notebook 2: Decision Tree: Model Selection & Combating Overfitting

      -- Task 1: Model selection for a Decision Tree Classifier via hyperparameter tuning

      -- Task 2: Understand how hyperparameter tuning reduces variance (handles overfitting)
      
      
- Notebook 3: Decision Tree: Regression

In this notebook, we perform regression using the Decision Tree model and compare its performance with other regression models.

      -- Decision Tree Regression

      -- Random Forest Regression

      -- Linear Regression by using the Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) technique

      -- Polynomial Regression (Regularized)
